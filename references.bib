  abstract     = {Policymakers and academics have long maintained that nominal
                  interest rates face a zero lower bound (ZLB), which can only
                  be breached through major institutional changes like the
                  elimination or taxation of paper currency. Recently, several
                  central banks have set interest rates as low as -0.75\%
                  without any such changes, suggesting that, in practice, money
                  demand remains finite even at negative nominal rates. I study
                  optimal monetary policy in this new environment, exploring the
                  central tradeoff: negative rates help stabilize aggregate
                  demand, but at the cost of an inefficient subsidy to paper
                  currency. Near 0\%, the first side of this tradeoff dominates,
                  and negative rates are generically optimal whenever output
                  averages below its efficient level. In a benchmark scenario,
                  breaking the ZLB with negative rates is sufficient to undo
                  most welfare losses relative to the first best. More
                  generally, the gains from negative rates depend inversely on
                  the level and elasticity of currency demand. Credible
                  commitment by the central bank is essential to implementing
                  optimal policy, which backloads the most negative rates. My
                  results imply that the option to set negative nominal rates
                  lowers the optimal long-run inflation target, and that
                  abolishing paper currency is only optimal when currency demand
                  is highly elastic. ∗I am deeply grateful to my advisors Iván

                  regional variation alone is difficult because of economic
                  channels and shocks that differ between regional and aggregate
                  economies. However, we argue that regional business cycles
                  contain valuable information that can help discipline models
                  of aggregate fluctuations. We begin by documenting a strong
                  relationship across U.S. states between local employment and
                  wage growth during the Great Recession. This relationship is
                  much weaker in U.S. aggregates. Then, we present a methodology
                  that combines such regional and aggregate data in order to
                  estimate a medium‐scale New Keynesian DSGE model. We find that
                  aggregate demand shocks were important drivers of aggregate
                  employment during the Great Recession, but the wage stickiness
                  necessary for them to account for the slow employment recovery
                  and the modest fall in aggregate wages is inconsistent with
                  the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S. states.
                  Finally, we show that our methodology yields different
                  conclusions about the causes of aggregate employment and wage
                  dynamics between 2007 and 2014 than either estimating our
                  model with aggregate data alone or performing
                  back‐of‐the‐envelope calculations that directly extrapolate
                  from well‐identified regional elasticities.},

                 elterjedt értékesítési mechanizmus, amely a modern

                 független egyéni értékelésű (IPV) modell aszimmetrikus
                 változatát vizsgálom. Az első fejezetben színes kis
                 történetekkel emlékezem meg az aukciók figyelemreméltó
                 múltjáról. A második fejezetben a mechanizmus tervezés releváns
                 eredményeit ismertetem. Ezzel elhelyezem az aukciókat a
                 közgazdaságtan rendszerében és megalapozom a későbbi eredmények
                 bizonyítását és értékelését. A harmadik fejezetben formalizálom
                 az aszimmetrikus IPV modellt. Bebizonyítom, hogy a másodáras
                 aukcó egy ösztönző, egyénileg racionális és hatékony direkt
                 mechanizmus, amelyben minden vevő egyensúlyi licitfüggvénye az
                 identitás leképezés. Megmutatom, hogy N licitáló mellett az
                 első áras aukció megoldása ekvivalens egy N
                 differenciálegyenletből és 2N peremfeltételből álló rendszer
                 megoldásával. Itt szembesülünk avval, hogy az aszimmetrikus
                 modell lényegesen bonyolultabb mint a szimmetrikus. Ez a
                 komplexitás két forrásból fakad. Először is nem ismert a jobb
                 oldali perem, másodszor a megoldás nem Lipschitz-tulajdonságú.
                 Nem csekély erőfeszítéssel, de megmutatható, hogy léteznek
                 egyértelmű, szigorúan növő egyensúlyi licitfüggvények. Ehhez
                 fel kell tennünk, hogy a vevők értékelései olyan heterogén
                 eloszlásokból származnak, amelyeknek közös a tartója,
                 sűrűségfüggvényeik pedig folytonosan differenciálhatóak és
                 sehol sem nullák. A dolgozatban a bizonyítások nem, csak az
                 alkalmas alakban kimondott tételek szerepelnek. A negyedik
                 fejezetben azzal a speciális esettel foglalkozom, mikor az
                 aukción két különböző egyenletes értékelésű licitáló vesz
                 részt. Ekkor a peremérték-feladat analitikusan megoldható. Az
                 explicit megoldás birtokában részletesen összevetem az első és
                 másodáras aukciót. Ehhez a játékosok ex ante nyerési esélyeit,
                 várható licitjeit, várható költségeit és várható többleteit,
                 valamint a várható eladási árat használom. A hatékony
                 kísérletezést segítik a C. függelék Matlab-kódjai, amelyeket az
                 ilyen típusú aukciók ábrázolásához és a fenti paraméterek gyors
                 számolásához írtam. Kiderül, hogy a bevétel ekvivalencia tétel
                 nem érvényes, legalábbis csak egy jóval gyengébb formában, mint
                 a szimmetrikus IPV modellben. Ez abból ered, hogy a
                 sztochasztikusan gyengébb vevő közelebb licitál a realizált
                 értékéhez. A szimulációk azt mutatják, hogy ennek az
                 agresszívebb licitálásnak a mértékét a két eloszlás tartóinak
                 aránya határozza meg, ugyanis éppen erre a szintre tornázza fel
                 a nyerési esélyét a gyengébb vevő. Ez a példa inspirálta, hogy
                 az ötödik fejezetben megvizsgáljam a vevők sztochasztikus
                 rendezettsége és a licitfüggvények helyzete közötti kapcsolatot
                 általános esetben is. Nem meglepő, hogy a gyengeség itt is
                 agresszívebb licitálást eredményez. Végül kitérek a modell
                 numerikus megoldhatóságára. Ehhez egy fixpont-iterációt
                 használtam. A módszer helyessége nem bizonyított, de a
                 szimulációs eredmények meggyőzőek. Az eljárás olyan különleges
                 esetekben is jól használható, mikor az eloszlásfüggvények
                 többször metszik egymást. Ehhez a részhez is kapcsolódik egy
                 érdekes szimulációs eredmény, nevezetesen, hogy a maximális
                 licit minden esetben a várható értékelések közé esik.},

                 population forecasts with household survey data from 25
                 countries, we measure the compositional effect of aging: how a
                 changing age distribution affects wealth-to-GDP, holding the
                 age profiles of assets and labor income fixed. In a baseline

                 microfounded general equilibrium models. Intertemporal marginal
                 propensities to consume (iMPCs) are sufficient statistics for
                 this response, with fiscal multipliers depending only on the

                 inconsistent with representative-agent or two-agent models, but
                 can be matched by certain heterogeneous-agent models. Models
                 that match empirical iMPCs imply larger and more persistent

                 (i) partial segmentation of home and foreign bond markets and
                 (ii) a pecuniary externality that makes the real exchange rate
                 excessively volatile in response to capital flows. Partial
                 segmentation implies that, by intervening in the bond markets,
                 the central bank can affect the exchange rate and the spread
                 between home- and foreign-bond yields. Such interventions allow
                 the central bank to address the pecuniary externality, but they
                 are also costly, as foreigners make carry-trade profits. We
                 analytically characterize the optimal intervention policy that
                 solves this trade-off: (a) the optimal policy leans against the
                 wind, stabilizing the exchange rate; (b) it involves smooth
                 spreads but allows exchange rates to jump; (c) it partly relies
                 on “forward guidance”, with non-zero interventions even after
                 the shock has subsided; (d) it requires credibility, in that
                 central banks do not intervene without commitment. Finally, we
                 shed light on the global consequences of widespread
                 interventions, using a multi-country extension of our model. We
                 find that, left to themselves, countries over-accumulate

                 conclusion, showing that it does not follow from the very
                 models used to derive them. For the model in Judd (1985), we
                 prove that the long run tax on capital is positive and
                 significant, whenever the intertemporal elasticity of
                 substitution is below one. For higher elasticities, the tax
                 converges to zero but may do so at a slow rate, after centuries
                 of high capital taxation. The model in Chamley (1986) imposes
                 an upper bound on capital taxation and we prove that the tax
                 rate may end up at this bound indefinitely. When, instead, the
                 bounds do not bind forever, the long run tax is indeed zero;
                 however, when preferences are recursive but non-additive across
                 time, the zero-capital-tax limit comes accompanied by zero
                 private wealth (zero tax base) or by zero labor taxes (first
                 best). Finally, we explain why the equivalence of a positive
                 capital tax with ever rising consumption taxes does not provide
                 a firm rationale against capital taxation.},

                  associated to the COVID-19 epidemic—shutdowns, layoffs, and
                  firm exits—may have this feature. In one-sector economies
                  supply shocks are never Keynesian. We show that this is a
                  general result that extend to economies with incomplete
                  markets and liquidity constrained consumers. In economies with
                  multiple sectors Keynesian supply shocks are possible, under
                  some conditions. A 50\% shock that hits all sectors is not the
                  same as a 100\% shock that hits half the economy. Incomplete
                  markets make the conditions for Keynesian supply shocks more
                  likely to be met. Firm exit and job destruction can amplify
                  the initial effect, aggravating the recession. We discuss the
                  effects of various policies. Standard fiscal stimulus can be
                  less effective than usual because the fact that some sectors

                  Monetary policy, as long as it is unimpeded by the zero lower

  abstract    = {We explore the quantitative effects of transitory and
                 persistent increases in income inequality on equilibrium
                 interest rates and output. Our starting point is a
                 Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model featuring rich heterogeneity and
                 earnings dynamics as well as downward nominal wage rigidities.
                 A temporary rise in inequality, if not accommodated by monetary
                 policy, has an immediate effect on output that can be
                 quantified using the empirical covariance between income and
                 marginal propensities to consume. A permanent rise in
                 inequality can lead to a permanent Keynesian recession, which
                 is not fully offset by monetary policy due to a lower bound on
                 interest rates. We show that the magnitude of the real interest
                 rate fall and the severity of the steady-state slump can be
                 approximated by simple formulas involving quantifiable
                 elasticities and shares, together with two parameters that
                 summarize the effect of idiosyncratic uncertainty and real
                 interest rates on aggregate savings. For plausible
                 parametrizations the rise in inequality can push the economy
                 into a liquidity trap and create a deep recession. Capital
                 investment and deficit-financed fiscal policy mitigate the fall
                 in real interest rates and the severity of the slump.},

  abstract     = {Abstract We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the
                  idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus
                  the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the
                  simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and
                  savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of
                  permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent
                  perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income
                  inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted
                  household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest.
                  Moreover, popular expansionary policies—such as accommodative
                  monetary policy—generate a debt-financed short-run boom at the
                  expense of indebted demand in the future. When demand is
                  sufficiently indebted, the economy gets stuck in a debt-driven
                  liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping a debt trap requires
                  consideration of less conventional macroeconomic policies,
                  such as those focused on redistribution or those reducing the
                  structural sources of high inequality.},
