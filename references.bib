                 regional variation alone is difficult because of economic
                 channels and shocks that differ between regional and aggregate
                 economies. However, we argue that regional business cycles
                 contain valuable information that can help discipline models
                 of aggregate fluctuations. We begin by documenting a strong
                 relationship across U.S. states between local employment and
                 wage growth during the Great Recession. This relationship is
                 much weaker in U.S. aggregates. Then, we present a methodology
                 that combines such regional and aggregate data in order to
                 estimate a medium‐scale New Keynesian DSGE model. We find that
                 aggregate demand shocks were important drivers of aggregate
                 employment during the Great Recession, but the wage stickiness
                 necessary for them to account for the slow employment recovery
                 and the modest fall in aggregate wages is inconsistent with
                 the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S. states.
                 Finally, we show that our methodology yields different
                 conclusions about the causes of aggregate employment and wage
                 dynamics between 2007 and 2014 than either estimating our
                 model with aggregate data alone or performing
                 back‐of‐the‐envelope calculations that directly extrapolate

                 Combining population forecasts with household survey data from
                 25 countries, we measure the compositional effect of aging:
                 how a changing age distribution affects wealth-to-GDP, holding
                 the age profiles of assets and labor income fixed. In a
                 baseline overlapping generations model this statistic, in
                 conjunction with cross-sectional information and two standard
                 macro parameters, pins down general equilibrium outcomes.
                 Since the compositional effect is positive, large, and
                 heterogeneous across countries, our model predicts that
                 population aging will increase wealth-to- GDP ratios, lower

                 (i) partial segmentation of home and foreign bond markets and
                 (ii) a pecuniary externality that makes the real exchange rate
                 excessively volatile in response to capital flows. Partial
                 segmentation implies that, by intervening in the bond markets,
                 the central bank can affect the exchange rate and the spread
                 between home- and foreign-bond yields. Such interventions
                 allow the central bank to address the pecuniary externality,
                 but they are also costly, as foreigners make carry-trade
                 profits. We analytically characterize the optimal intervention
                 policy that solves this trade-off: (a) the optimal policy
                 leans against the wind, stabilizing the exchange rate; (b) it
                 involves smooth spreads but allows exchange rates to jump; (c)
                 it partly relies on ``forward guidance'', with non-zero
                 interventions even after the shock has subsided; (d) it
                 requires credibility, in that central banks do not intervene
                 without commitment. Finally, we shed light on the global
                 consequences of widespread interventions, using a
                 multi-country extension of our model. We find that, left to

  abstract    = "According to the Chamley-Judd result, capital should not be
                 taxed in the long run. In this paper, we overturn this
                 conclusion, showing that it does not follow from the very
                 models used to derive them. For the model in Judd (1985), we
                 prove that the long run tax on capital is positive and
                 significant, whenever the intertemporal elasticity of
                 substitution is below one. For higher elasticities, the tax
                 converges to zero but may do so at a slow rate, after
                 centuries of high capital taxation. The model in Chamley
                 (1986) imposes an upper bound on capital taxation and we prove
                 that the tax rate may end up at this bound indefinitely. When,
                 instead, the bounds do not bind forever, the long run tax is
                 indeed zero; however, when preferences are recursive but
                 non-additive across time, the zero-capital-tax limit comes
                 accompanied by zero private wealth (zero tax base) or by zero
                 labor taxes (first best). Finally, we explain why the
                 equivalence of a positive capital tax with ever rising
                 consumption taxes does not provide a firm rationale against
                 capital taxation.",

               COVID-19 epidemic---shutdowns, layoffs, and firm exits---may
               have this feature. In one-sector economies supply shocks are
               never Keynesian. We show that this is a general result that
               extend to economies with incomplete markets and liquidity
               constrained consumers. In economies with multiple sectors
               Keynesian supply shocks are possible, under some conditions. A
               50\% shock that hits all sectors is not the same as a 100\%
               shock that hits half the economy. Incomplete markets make the
               conditions for Keynesian supply shocks more likely to be met.
               Firm exit and job destruction can amplify the initial effect,
               aggravating the recession. We discuss the effects of various
               policies. Standard fiscal stimulus can be less effective than
               usual because the fact that some sectors are shut down mutes the
               Keynesian multiplier feedback. Monetary policy, as long as it is
               unimpeded by the zero lower bound, can have magnified effects,
               by preventing firm exits. Turning to optimal policy, closing

  abstract    = "Abstract We propose a theory of indebted demand, capturing the
                 idea that large debt burdens lower aggregate demand, and thus
                 the natural rate of interest. At the core of the theory is the
                 simple yet underappreciated observation that borrowers and
                 savers differ in their marginal propensities to save out of
                 permanent income. Embedding this insight in a two-agent
                 perpetual-youth model, we find that recent trends in income
                 inequality and financial deregulation lead to indebted
                 household demand, pushing down the natural rate of interest.
                 Moreover, popular expansionary policies---such as
                 accommodative monetary policy---generate a debt-financed
                 short-run boom at the expense of indebted demand in the
                 future. When demand is sufficiently indebted, the economy gets
                 stuck in a debt-driven liquidity trap, or debt trap. Escaping
                 a debt trap requires consideration of less conventional
                 macroeconomic policies, such as those focused on
                 redistribution or those reducing the structural sources of
                 high inequality.",
